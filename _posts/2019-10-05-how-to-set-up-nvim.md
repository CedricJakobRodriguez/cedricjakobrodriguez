In my last post i went over my history of editors and the good, the bad and the
ugly about finally switching to vim, now its time to talk more about dem configs
boi. My configs are a heavily modified version from
[Optixal's Neovim Init.vim](https://github.com/Optixal/neovim-init.vim), i have
replaced some of the plugs and added my own bindings and auto completion
plugins.

#### Plugin Management

for plugins i left vim-plug as it is because well its great, gets the job done
and doesn't really interfere in any way, yes i do use a lot of plugins, however
most of them i consider necessary for a great IDE experience, out of the box
most of these functions are missing or hidden, i have added a comment for each
plugin explaining what it does.

### superior auto completion
the original Optical configs used deoplete for completion which is kinda heavy
and slow (this laptop is running an 10 APU) for this machine, i tried coc which
was good and super responsive but also still heavy especially with python files
(jedi) i had many other options to pick from but i choose ncm2 because its fully
written in vim script and was meant for Nvim so its a native environment for
it, and it works pretty good so far the pop-up comes up pretty fast and the
snippets work as intended. the good thing is i didn't really need to do a very
extensive setup because well this works by default i had to modify is the
mapping and other simple stuff which i could've used another plugin for.

#### Visual changes:

just as usual it has to be material ocean themed, and vim being a popular editor
its already there and no need to reinvent the wheel,
[kaicataldo's themes](https://github.com/kaicataldo/material.vim) include it and
you can easily set it up, other visual changes include a modified air line and a
minimal NERDTree.

<pre>
<code class="language-vim">
let g:material_style='oceanic'
set background=dark
colorscheme vim-material
let g:airline_theme='material'
highlight Pmenu guibg=white guifg=black gui=bold
highlight Comment gui=bold
highlight Normal gui=none
highlight NonText guibg=none
autocmd ColorScheme * highlight VertSplit cterm=NONE ctermfg=Green ctermbg=NONE

##### nifty tricks
these are Vim built in options that are not set up by default or are set to not
so good defaults, i found most of these while trying to do a specific task, i
used to use mswin behavior (makes Nvim behave more like a regular text editor)
but now i don't think i need it anymore, still haven't mastered the moved as i did
with good ol' plasma.

##### NERDTree
these configs are the best, i kanged the icons from some repo
which i can't remember, it includes minimal ui (hides the top help text and other
stuff), and ignores .git and Jekyll build files by default. It also quites when
you open a file so you can immediately focus on the file
<pre>
<code class="language-vim">
let NERDTreeShowHidden=1
let NERDTreeShowLineNumbers=0
let g:NERDTreeDirArrowExpandable = ''
let g:NERDTreeDirArrowCollapsible = ''
let NERDTreeQuitOnOpen = 1
let NERDTreeMinimalUI = 1
let NERDTreeDirArrows = 1
let g:NERDTreeIgnore = [
\ '\.vim$',
\ '\~$',
\ '.git',
\ '_site',
\]
</code>
</pre>

#### Airline

airline is a fantastic status bar that shows important information like the
language, encoding and current mode you're in. my airline configs are pretty
simple as well, the only big difference compared to the defaults is the added
current line and percentage of the file at the right of the bar, also spell
check

<pre>
<code class="language-vim">
" Airline
let g:airline_powerline_fonts = 0
let g:airline#themes#clean#palette = 1
call airline#parts#define_raw('linenr', '%l')
call airline#parts#define_accent('linenr', 'bold')
let g:airline_section_z = airline#section#create(['%3p%%  ',
\ g:airline_symbols.linenr .' ', 'linenr', ':%c '])
let g:airline_section_warning = ''
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#enabled = 1
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#fnamemod = ':t'        " show only file name on tabs
</code>

#### Other great features

- auto line indentation
- display tags via tag bar
- FZF integration
- Grammer checking via Grammerous
- Snippets via Ultisnips
- startify when no buffer is open
- open images via feh

#### Key Mappings

The default key maps are ok but they're missing some essential things like block
selection without going back to visual mode, fast split switching and split
rotation, so i made my own bindings for all these, some are from nvim help and
others are scattered from the web.<br> i also fixed the annoying block selection
will copy the selected text to the clipboard by using the void register for
delete operations, this way deleting a visual block will just delete it without
adding it to the clipboard.

```vim
" use a different buffer for dd
nnoremap d "_d
vnoremap d "_d

" emulate windows copy, cut behavior
noremap <LeftRelease> "+y<LeftRelease>
noremap <C-c> "+y<CR>
noremap <C-x> "+d<CR>

" switch between splits using ctrl + {h,j,k,l}
tnoremap <C-h> <C-\><C-N><C-w>h
tnoremap <C-j> <C-\><C-N><C-w>j
tnoremap <C-k> <C-\><C-N><C-w>k
tnoremap <C-l> <C-\><C-N><C-w>l
inoremap <C-h> <C-\><C-N><C-w>h
inoremap <C-j> <C-\><C-N><C-w>j
inoremap <C-k> <C-\><C-N><C-w>k
inoremap <C-l> <C-\><C-N><C-w>l
nnoremap <C-h> <C-w>h
nnoremap <C-j> <C-w>j
nnoremap <C-k> <C-w>k
nnoremap <C-l> <C-w>l

" select text via ctrl+shift+arrows in insert mode
inoremap <C-S-left> <esc>vb
inoremap <C-S-right> <esc>ve
```

#### Other shortcuts

- F3 for nerdtree
- f4 for tagbar
- f5 to rotate splits
- maybe more

and thats all from me, these settings do almost everything i need from an IDE
and keep me focused on the actual writing/coding part, and finally you can
checkout the file configuration file in my
[dotfiles repo](https://github.com/Blacksuan19/Dotfiles/blob/master/nvim/.config/nvim/init.vim).
