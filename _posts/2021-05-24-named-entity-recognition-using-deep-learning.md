The goal of this project is to implement a bi-directional LSTM functional neural
network that can classify named entities. the dataset has been extracted from
GMB corpus and it is structured in a way that makes it easier to train a model
for named entity recognition or part of speech tagging, however, we will be
making use of only the named entity recognition part.

included entities:

- geo = Geographical Entity
- org = Organization
- per = Person
- gpe = Geopolitical Entity
- tim = Time indicator
- art = Artifact
- eve = Event
- nat = Natural Phenomenon

# Data Exploration

```python
# getting the data
file = "../input/entity-annotated-corpus/ner_dataset.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(file, encoding = "latin1")

# drop the POS column because we dont need it
data = data.drop('POS', 1)
```

first lets take a look at our dataset by using the head function

```python
data.head()
```

<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }

</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>Sentence #</th>
      <th>Word</th>
      <th>Tag</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>Sentence: 1</td>
      <td>Thousands</td>
      <td>O</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>NaN</td>
      <td>of</td>
      <td>O</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>NaN</td>
      <td>demonstrators</td>
      <td>O</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>NaN</td>
      <td>have</td>
      <td>O</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>NaN</td>
      <td>marched</td>
      <td>O</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

the data has some na values, those values should be the number of the sentese,
lets fix that

```python
# Fill na
data = data.fillna(method = 'ffill')
```

seperate the words and tags into their own lists, later on this will be used for
various actions including making the training and testing datasets and also when
doing the prediction, another important number we need is the total number of
tags which will be used for output sizes

```python
words = list(set(data["Word"].values))
words.append("ENDPAD")
num_words = len(words)

print(f"Total number of unique words in dataset: {num_words}")
```

    Total number of unique words in dataset: 35179

```python
tags = list(set(data["Tag"].values))
num_tags = len(tags)
num_tags
print("List of tags: " + ', '.join([tag for tag in tags]))
print(f"Total Number of tags {num_tags}")
```

    List of tags: B-nat, B-tim, I-org, B-art, B-org, I-eve, B-eve, B-per, I-per, I-geo, I-tim, B-gpe, I-gpe, I-nat, I-art, B-geo, O
    Total Number of tags 17

lets make a class that will get get us a full sentense from our data, this is
just for data exploration

```python
class Get_sentence(object):
    def __init__(self,data):
        self.n_sent = 1
        self.data = data
        agg_func = lambda s:[(w, t) for w, t in zip(s["Word"].values.tolist(),
                                                    s["Tag"].values.tolist())]
        self.grouped = self.data.groupby("Sentence #").apply(agg_func)
        self.sentences = [s for s in self.grouped]
```

```python
getter = Get_sentence(data)
sentence = getter.sentences
sentence[10]
```

    [('In', 'O'),
     ('Beirut', 'B-geo'),
     (',', 'O'),
     ('a', 'O'),
     ('string', 'O'),
     ('of', 'O'),
     ('officials', 'O'),
     ('voiced', 'O'),
     ('their', 'O'),
     ('anger', 'O'),
     (',', 'O'),

     ('Siniora', 'I-per'),
     ('said', 'O'),
     ('the', 'O'),
     ('Lebanese', 'B-gpe'),

# Data Visualization

lets take a look at the distrbution of our words and tags in graphs which are
easier to understand

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(14,7))
plt.hist([len(s) for s in sentence],bins = 50)
plt.xlabel("Length of Sentences")
plt.show()
```

![png](/assets/images/named-entity-recognition-using-deep-learning_files/named-entity-recognition-using-deep-learning_15_0.png)

most of our sentenses have a length of 20 words, the longest sentense is around
63 words

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))
data.Tag[data.Tag != 'O']\
    .value_counts()\
    .plot\
    .barh();
```

![png](/assets/images/named-entity-recognition-using-deep-learning_files/named-entity-recognition-using-deep-learning_17_0.png)

from the tags graph, we can observe that B-geo places are overrepresented, that
might confuse the model, and also I-nat and I-gpe are almost non-existent in the
dataset, we can already predict that the model might have issues classifying
these 2 tags because of not enough training data for them.

# Preparing Data

When training a machine learning model we need to use sentences of an equal
length, we are going to pad each of our sentences to a total length of 50 words,
this might cut some sentences short but I believe thats fine since those are
only a very few. an index mapping is a way we can link the tags and words
numerically, each word has an index number and each tag has an index number as
well, we can pass these number to our neural network and it will be able to
learn with it efficiently, when we are doing prediction we use the predicted
number as an index in our tags, words index list and get the actual tag, word.

```python
word_idx = {w : i + 1 for i ,w in enumerate(words)}
tag_idx =  {t : i for i ,t in enumerate(tags)}
```

```python
tag_idx
```

    {'B-nat': 0,
     'B-tim': 1,
     'I-org': 2,
     'B-art': 3,
     'B-org': 4,
     'I-eve': 5,
     'B-eve': 6,
     'B-per': 7,
     'I-per': 8,
     'I-geo': 9,
     'I-tim': 10,
     'B-gpe': 11,
     'I-gpe': 12,
     'I-nat': 13,
     'I-art': 14,
     'B-geo': 15,
     'O': 16}

lets finally pad our sentenses using a max length of 50

```python
max_len = 50
X = [[word_idx[w[0]] for w in s] for s in sentence]
X = pad_sequences(maxlen = max_len, sequences = X, padding = 'post', value = num_words - 1)

y = [[tag_idx[w[1]] for w in s] for s in sentence]
y = pad_sequences(maxlen = max_len, sequences = y, padding = 'post', value = tag_idx['O'])
y = [to_categorical(i, num_classes = num_tags) for i in  y]
```

now lets split the data into training and testing, we will use a testing dataset
size of 10%, i belive that should be enough

```python
x_train,x_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(X, y,test_size = 0.1, random_state = 1)
```

# Building the Model

We will implement a functional model rather than a sequential one, the reason
behind this is a functional model provided us with better accuracy in the
current situation, we should always use the model that works best for the job,
for example, a sequential Max Pooled LSTM did give me better results when doing
a project about predicting COVID-19 cases, another reason is that a functional
model is more flexible and allows us to have multiple inputs or output layers
(thats more of a Keras API thing).

our loss measurement is categorical cross-entropy due to the prediction output
and input being categorical labels in the end, for the optimizer, we will stick
with adam because it works in most cases, we could adjust the learning rate for
it but I donâ€™t think that's necessary.

```python
input_word = Input(shape = (max_len,))
model = Embedding(input_dim = num_words, output_dim = max_len, input_length = max_len)(input_word)
model = SpatialDropout1D(0.1)(model)
model = Bidirectional(LSTM(units = 100,return_sequences = True, recurrent_dropout = 0.1))(model)
out = TimeDistributed(Dense(num_tags,activation = 'softmax'))(model)
model = Model(input_word,out)

model.compile(optimizer = 'adam',loss = 'categorical_crossentropy',metrics = ['accuracy'])
model.summary()
```

    Model: "functional_1"
    _________________________________________________________________
    Layer (type)                 Output Shape              Param #
    =================================================================
    input_1 (InputLayer)         [(None, 50)]              0
    _________________________________________________________________
    embedding (Embedding)        (None, 50, 50)            1758950
    _________________________________________________________________
    spatial_dropout1d (SpatialDr (None, 50, 50)            0
    _________________________________________________________________
    bidirectional (Bidirectional (None, 50, 200)           120800
    _________________________________________________________________
    time_distributed (TimeDistri (None, 50, 17)            3417
    =================================================================
    Total params: 1,883,167
    Trainable params: 1,883,167
    Non-trainable params: 0
    _________________________________________________________________

after building the model, the summary function shows us all the layers of the
model and their parameters, inputs, and outputs, a better way to show such
information is by using the plot_model method

we can see the final TimeDistributed layer outputs 50 tags of 17 types

```python
plot_model(model, show_shapes = True)
```

Finally, we now train our model with these parameters

- batch size: the number of words the model will train on at each time, the
  reason we chose 64 is sort of arbitrary, however, 64 \* 540(total number of
  batches) = 34560 which is very close to our total number of words and tags, a
  higher batch number might speed up the training but will also reduce the
  accuracy.

- epochs: the number of times the model will train through all the data, a
  higher number of epochs will not necessarily improve the accuracy. in fact, it
  might cause overfitting that is why we will stick to only 3 epochs.

- validation split: the amount of data which will be used to validate the model
  during training, we will use 20% of our training dataset (do not confuse
  validation with testing, both are totally different things)

```python
model.fit(x_train, np.array(y_train), batch_size = 64, verbose = 1, epochs = 3, validation_split = 0.2)
```

    Epoch 1/3
    540/540 [==============================] - 74s 138ms/step - loss: 0.2724 - accuracy: 0.9414 - val_loss: 0.1307 - val_accuracy: 0.9611
    Epoch 2/3
    540/540 [==============================] - 78s 145ms/step - loss: 0.0838 - accuracy: 0.9767 - val_loss: 0.0624 - val_accuracy: 0.9820
    Epoch 3/3
    540/540 [==============================] - 74s 136ms/step - loss: 0.0496 - accuracy: 0.9855 - val_loss: 0.0531 - val_accuracy: 0.9842

after the model has been trained the final loss is 0.439, and the final accuracy
is 0.9845 which is 98.45% very high accuracy, I donâ€™t think the model is
overfitted because as we will see later on while predicting it has no problem
working with foreign data.

Finally, letâ€™s evaluate the model using our testing dataset

# Model Evaluation

```python
model.evaluate(x_test, np.array(y_test))
```

    150/150 [==============================] - 3s 18ms/step - loss: 0.0554 - accuracy: 0.9840





    [0.05543701350688934, 0.9840325117111206]

as you can see the testing dataset accuracy is very high as well, confirming
that the model is not overfitted, now letâ€™s try to tag random sentences from our
training dataset and printing the original values compared to the values
predicted by our model

```python
rand_sent = np.random.randint(0, x_test.shape[0]) # get a random sentense
p = model.predict(np.array([x_test[rand_sent]]))
p = np.argmax(p, axis = -1)

y_true = np.argmax(np.array(y_test), axis = -1)[rand_sent] # get actual tags for random sentense

print("{:20}{:20}\t{}\n".format("Word", "True", "Pred"))
print("-" * 55)

for (w, t, pred) in zip(x_test[rand_sent], y_true, p[0]):
    print("{:20}{:20}\t{}".format(words[w - 1], tags[t], tags[pred]))
```

    Word                True                	Pred

now lets create a function so anyone can input their data and the model will do
entity recognition on it!

```python
def create_test_input_from_text(text):
    word_list = text.split(" ")
    x_new = []
    for word in word_list:
        x_new.append(word_idx[word])

    p = model.predict(np.array([x_new]))
    p = np.argmax(p, axis = -1)
    print("{:20}\t{}\n".format("Word", "Prediction"))
    print("-" * 35)

    for (w, pred) in zip(range(len(x_new)), p[0]):
        print("{:20}\t{}".format(word_list[w], tags[pred]))
```

```python

test_inputs = "the weather in London is very hot"
create_test_input_from_text(test_inputs)
```

    Word                	Prediction

    ------------------------------
    the                 	O
    weather             	O
    in                  	O
    London              	B-geo
    is                  	O
    very                	O
    hot                 	O

```python

test_inputs = "my friend Mohammed is travelling to Oman"
create_test_input_from_text(test_inputs)
```

    Word                	Prediction

    ------------------------------

    to                  	O

```
